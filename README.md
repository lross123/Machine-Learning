- **Linear Algebra**  
  - Backpropagation mathematics  
  - Vector spaces, orthogonality, projections  
  - Inner products & angles

- **Machine Learning**  
  - Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - PageRank algorithm

- **Neural Networks**  
  - Fitting distributions of helices  
  - Gradient-based optimization exercises

- **Miscellaneous**  
  - Transformation matrices and reflections (e.g. “Reflecting Bear” exercise)

## Tech Stack
- Python, Jupyter  
- NumPy, SciPy  
- Matplotlib, custom scripts
